RLE String Encoder with Validation

Objective:
Write a function encode that performs run-length encoding (RLE) on a string of printable ASCII characters. The function must strictly follow the rules below.

Rules and Constraints

Alphabetic characters only
The function should process letters A–Z and a–z only.
If the string contains any non-alphabetic character, the function must print nothing and return immediately.

Run-length encoding
Consecutive identical characters are replaced with a count followed by the character.
Example: "aaabbc" → "3a2bc".
Single characters are printed as-is.

Maximum run length
If a run of consecutive identical characters is longer than 9, the function must print nothing and return immediately.
